# Electric Mountain Railway Ticketing System
◘This is a Python program that simulates a ticketing system for an electric mountain railway. It includes functionalities to start the day, purchase tickets, and generate end-of-day summaries for the railway.
◘Features
- Initialize the system at the start of the day.
- Purchase tickets for individual passengers or groups with group discounts.
- Track the number of passengers and revenue for each train journey.
- Generate an end-of-day summary with detailed statistics.
 ◘Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Run the program using a Python interpreter:
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to initialize the system, purchase tickets, and generate end-of-day summaries.
◘ Usage
- Initialize the system: This should be done at the beginning of the day to set up the screen display and data structures for the railway's operation.
- Purchase tickets: You can buy tickets for a single passenger or a group. The system checks ticket availability and calculates the total price, including group discounts.
- End of the day summary: This generates a report showing the number of passengers that traveled on each train journey, the total money taken for each journey, the total number of passengers for the day, and the total revenue. It also identifies the most popular journey.
◘ Example Usage
```python
purchase_tickets(0, 4, 20)  # Purchasing 20 tickets for up-train 1 and down-train 1
purchase_tickets(2, 6, 15)  # Purchasing 15 tickets for up-train 3 and down-train 3
end_of_day_summary()  # Display end of day summary
